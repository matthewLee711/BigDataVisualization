It was first celebrated in 1970, and is now coordinated globally by the [[Earth Day Network]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.earthday.net/ |title=Earth Day Network |publisher=Earthday.net |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2011}}</ref> and celebrated in more than 192 countries each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://earthday.org/countries |title=Earth Day International |deadurl=yes |archivedate=March 15, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315055335/http://www.earthday.org/countries |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref> In 1969 at a [[UNESCO]] Conference in San Francisco, [[List of peace activists|peace activist]] [[John McConnell (peace activist)|John McConnell]] proposed a day to honor the Earth and the concept of peace, to first be celebrated on March 21, 1970, the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere. This day of nature's equipoise was later sanctioned in a Proclamation written by McConnell and signed by Secretary General [[U Thant]] at the [[United Nations]]. A month later a separate Earth Day was founded by [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Gaylord Nelson]] as an environmental [[teach-in]] first held on April 22, 1970. Nelson was later awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom Award in recognition of his work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.care2.com/greenliving/a-brief-history-of-earth-day.html |title=Earth Day &#124; Care2 Healthy Living |publisher=Care2.com |date= |accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref> While this April 22 Earth Day was focused on the United States, an organization launched by [[Denis Hayes]], who was the original national coordinator in 1970, took it international in 1990 and organized events in 141 nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bullitt.org/who-we-are/staff |title=Staff — The Builtt Foundation |publisher=Bullitt.org |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://therumpus.net/2009/04/the-rumpus-interview-with-denis-hayes/ |title=The Rumpus Interview With Earth Day Organizer Denis Hayes |publisher=The Rumpus.net |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2011}}</ref> Numerous communities celebrate '''Earth Week''', an entire week of activities focused on environmental issues. == Earth Day 1970 == The first Earth Day family had participants and celebrants in two thousand colleges and universities, roughly ten thousand primary and secondary schools, and hundreds of communities across the United States.

Among the group were Fred Kent, Pete Grannis, and Kristin and William Hubbard. This New York group agreed to head up the New York City part of the national movement. Fred Kent took the lead in renting an office and recruiting volunteers. "The big break came when Mayor Lindsay agreed to shut down Fifth Avenue for the event. A giant cheer went up in the office on that day," according to Kristin Hubbard (now Kristin Alexandre). 'From that time on we used Mayor Lindsay's offices and even his staff. I was Speaker Coordinator but had tremendous help from Lindsay staffer Judith Crichton." In addition to shutting down [[Fifth Avenue]], Mayor [[John Lindsay]] made [[Central Park]] available for Earth Day. The crowd was estimated as more than one million—by far the largest in the nation.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Since [[Manhattan]] was also the home of [[NBC]], [[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and ''[[Newsweek]]'', it provided the best possible anchor for national coverage from their reporters throughout the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/earthday/01.htm |title=The Spirit of the First Earth Day|publisher=U.S.Environmental Protection Agency|date=January–February 1990|accessdate=April 22, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328214819/http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/earthday/01.htm|archivedate=March 28, 2010}}</ref> ===Philadelphia=== [[Image:Ed-Muskie-at-Earth-Day-1970-web.jpg|thumb|upright|U.S. Senator [[Edmund Muskie]] speaking to an estimated 40–60,000 at Fairmount Park, Philadelphia on Earth Day, 1970]] The event was hosted by environmentalist [[Ira Einhorn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42711922/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/earth-day-co-founder-killed-composted-girlfriend/#.UXX-c7WG2Sq |title=Earth Day co-founder killed, composted girlfriend|publisher=NBC News|date=April 2011|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}</ref> U.S. Senator [[Edmund Muskie]] was the keynote speaker on Earth Day in Fairmount Park in Philadelphia.

Dillon Ripley]], secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], believes that in 25 years, somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct." * Peter Gunter, a professor at [[North Texas State University]], stated, "... by 1975 widespread famines will begin in India; these will spread by 1990 to include all of India, Pakistan, China and the Near East, Africa. By the year 2000, or conceivably sooner, South and Central America will exist under famine conditions.... By the year 2000, thirty years from now, the entire world, with the exception of Western Europe, North America, and Australia, will be in famine." * [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]], author of [[The Population Bomb]], predicted that between 1980 and 1989, 4 billion people, including 65 million Americans, would starve to death. * [[Life Magazine]] wrote, "... by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half." *Ecologist Kenneth Watt stated, "The world has been chilling sharply for about twenty years. If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in the year 2000. This is about twice what it would take to put us into an [[ice age]]." * Watt also stated, "By the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate…that there won’t be any more crude oil." ==Earth Day 1990== [[File:Ed20-peace-climb-logo-web.jpg|thumb|The official logo of the [[Mount Everest]] [[Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb]]]] Mobilizing 200 million people in 141 countries and lifting the status of [[list of environmental issues|environmental issues]] onto the world stage, Earth Day activities in 1990 gave a huge boost to [[recycling]] efforts worldwide and helped pave the way for the 1992 [[United Nations]] [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Unlike the first Earth Day in 1970, this 20th Anniversary was waged with stronger marketing tools, greater access to television and radio, and multimillion-dollar budgets.<ref name="nytimes1989"/> Two separate groups formed to sponsor Earth Day events in 1990: The Earth Day 20 Foundation, assembled by [[Edward Furia]] (Project Director of Earth Week in 1970), and Earth Day 1990, assembled by [[Denis Hayes]] (National Coordinator for Earth Day 1970). Senator [[Gaylord Nelson]], the original founder of Earth Day, was honorary chairman for both groups. The two did not combine forces over disagreements about leadership of combined organization and incompatible structures and strategies.<ref name="nytimes1989">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/12/business/the-business-of-earth-day.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Business of Earth Day |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=November 12, 1989 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}</ref> Among the disagreements, key Earth Day 20 Foundation organizers were critical of Earth Day 1990 for including on their board [[Hewlett-Packard]], a company that at the time was the second-biggest emitter of chlorofluorocarbons in Silicon Valley and refused to switch to alternative solvents.<ref name="nytimes1989"/> In terms of marketing, Earth Day 20 had a grassroots approach to organizing and relied largely on locally based groups like the [[National Toxics Campaign]], a Boston-based coalition of 1,000 local groups concerned with industrial pollution. Earth Day 1990 employed strategies including focus group testing, direct mail fund raising, and email marketing.<ref name="nytimes1989" /> The Earth Day 20 Foundation highlighted its April 22 activities in [[George, Washington]], near the [[Columbia River]] with a live satellite phone call with members of the historic [[Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb]] who called from their base camp on [[Mount Everest]] to pledge their support for world peace and attention to environmental issues.<ref name="google1">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=4oJvMfeQlr8C&dat=19900423&printsec=frontpage Ellensburg Daily Record – Google News Archive Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb was led by [[Jim Whittaker]], the first American to summit Mt. Everest (many years earlier), and marked the first time in history that mountaineers from the [[United States]], [[Soviet Union]], and [[China]] had roped together to climb a mountain, let alone Mt. Everest.<ref name="google1"/> The group also collected more than two tons of trash (transported down the mountain by support groups along the way) that was left behind on Mount Everest from previous climbing expeditions. The master of ceremonies for the Columbia Gorge event was the TV star, [[John Ratzenberger]], from "[[Cheers]]", and the headlining musician was the "Father of Rock and Roll," [[Chuck Berry]].<ref name="google1"/> [[Warner Bros. Records]] released an Earth Day-themed single in 1990 entitled "Tomorrow's World", written by [[Kix Brooks]] (who would later become one-half of [[Brooks & Dunn]]) and [[Pam Tillis]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/28757025.html?dids=28757025:28757025&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Apr+22%2C+1990&author=Jack+Hurst%2C+Country+music+writer&pub=Chicago+Tribune+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=Earth+calling.+.+.Help!+Cautious+Nashville+is+starting+to+turn+green&pqatl=google |title=Earth calling. . .Help!

This was the first year that Earth Day used the [[Internet]] as its principal organizing tool, and it proved invaluable nationally and internationally. Kelly Evans, a professional political organizer, served as executive director of the 2000 campaign. The event ultimately enlisted more than 5,000 environmental groups outside the United States, reaching hundreds of millions of people in a record 183 countries.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/23/us/peaceful-easy-feeling-imbues-30th-earth-day.html?pagewanted=1 |work=The New York Times |title=Peaceful, Easy Feeling Imbues 30th Earth Day |first=Jeff |last=Gerth |date=April 23, 2000 |deadurl=no |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref> [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] was the official host for the event,<ref name="nytimes.com"/> and about 400,000 participants stood in the cold rain during the course of the day. ==Subsequent Earth Day events== [[Image:Earth Day 2007 at City College San Diego.JPG|thumb|Earth Day 2007 at [[San Diego City College]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]]]] To turn Earth Day into a sustainable annual event rather than one that occurred every 10 years, Nelson and Bruce Anderson, New Hampshire's lead organizers in 1990, formed Earth Day USA. Building on the momentum created by thousands of community organizers around the world, Earth Day USA coordinated the next five Earth Day celebrations through 1995, including the launch of EarthDay.org. Following the 25th Anniversary in 1995, the coordination baton was handed to Earth Day Network. As the millennium approached, Hayes agreed to spearhead another campaign, this time focusing on [[global warming]] and pushing for [[Sustainable energy|clean energy]]. The April 22 Earth Day in 2000 combined the big-picture feistiness of the first Earth Day with the international grassroots activism of Earth Day 1990. For 2000, Earth Day had the [[internet]] to help link activists around the world. By the time April 22 came around, 5,000 environmental groups around the world were on board reaching out to hundreds of millions of people in a record 184 countries. Events varied: A [[talking drum]] chain traveled from village to village in [[Gabon]], [[Africa]], for example, while hundreds of thousands of people gathered on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], USA. Earth Day 2007 was one of the largest Earth Days to date, with many people participating in the activities in thousands of places including [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]; [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]]; [[Tuvalu]]; [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]; [[Togo]]; [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]; [[London]]; and [[New York]].

Tinari, then a graduate student in Engineering Physics/Solar Engineering at Queen's University. Flora MacDonald, then MP for Kingston and the Islands and Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, officially opened Earth Day Week on September 6, 1980 with a ceremonial tree planting and encouraged MPs and MPPs across the country to declare a cross-Canada annual Earth Day. The principal activities taking place on the first Earth Day included educational lectures given by experts in various environmental fields, garbage and litter pick-up by students along city roads and highways as well as tree plantings to replace the trees killed by Dutch Elm Disease.<ref>Tait, Teresa (July 23, 1980), "A Little Litter is Too Much", ''Kingston This Week''.</ref><ref>Wright, Sylvia (July 1980), "Canada's First Earth Day Scheduled for Sept. 11", ''The Kingston Whig Standard''.</ref> [[File:Paul Tinari Officially Launching the Canadian First Earth Day on September 11, 1980.jpg|thumb|Paul Tinari officially launching the first Canadian Earth Day on September 11, 1980 – waiting to speak are Flora MacDonald MP, secretary of state for external affairs, Ken Keyes, mayor of Kingston, and Dr. Ronald Watts, principal of Queen's University]] Earth Day Canada (EDC) is a national environmental charity founded in 1990 that provides Canadians with practical knowledge, tools, and simple easy-to-accomplish actions to support a healthier environment through EDC's year-round and award-winning programs. Education: EcoKids supports teachers and students, grades K-8, with free educational resources, curriculum-linked lesson plans including ESL and FSL, and homework help and games for students. EcoMentors offers youth the training and resources they need to facilitate local environmental education workshops with their peers and other young Canadians. Action: EDC's challenges, contests and campaigns promote practical, culturally relevant and cost-effective solutions to help individual Canadians support a healthier environment. EDC also encourages action by supporting individuals and community groups in the organization and delivery of local Earth Day (April 22) events. Recognition and Financial Support: Toyota Earth Day Scholarship Program recognizes tomorrow's environmental leaders providing twenty $5 000 scholarships to graduating high school students going on to post-secondary education in the discipline of their choice. The Hometown Heroes Award Program recognizes environmental leaders at the community level with an individual and a group award (each with a cash-prize of $10 000), and business leaders with a small business award. Earth Day Canada's Community Environment Fund funds sustainable community projects in Ontario providing grants of up to $20 000 to schools and not-for-profit organizations. The Diversity Engagement and Inclusion Initiative helps the environmental sector to better communicate with, engage and activate Canada's diverse social and cultural communities. The Employee Engagement program works with employers to achieve business and sustainability goals through inclusion of best practices. ==History of the Equinox Earth Day (March 20)== The equinoctial Earth Day is celebrated on the [[March equinox]] (around March 20) to mark the precise moment of astronomical [[spring (season)|spring]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and of astronomical [[autumn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. An [[equinox]] in astronomy is that point in time (not a whole day) when the Sun is directly above the Earth's equator, occurring around March 20 and September 23 each year. In most cultures, the [[equinox]]es and [[solstice]]s are considered to start or separate the [[season]]s. [[John McConnell (peace activist)|John McConnell]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.earthsite.org |title=EarthSite |publisher="EarthSite" |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2010}}</ref> first introduced the idea of a global holiday called "Earth Day" at the 1969 [[UNESCO]] Conference on the Environment. The first Earth Day [[proclamation]] was issued by [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying: <blockquote> May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful [[Spaceship Earth]] as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |deadurl=no |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref> </blockquote> United Nations secretary-general [[Kurt Waldheim]] observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). [[Margaret Mead]] added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared: <blockquote> "Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.<br /> Earth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way – which is also the most ancient way – by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate."<ref>Margaret Mead, "Earth Day," EPA Journal, March 1978.</ref> </blockquote> At the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the [[Japanese Peace Bell]], which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/pubs/cyberschoolbus/untour/subjap.htm |title=Japanese Peace Bell |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2013}}</ref> Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration.

This was the first of several events held at university campuses across the United States in the lead-up to the first Earth Day. Also, [[Ralph Nader]] began talking about the importance of [[ecology]] in 1970. The 1960s had been a very dynamic period for ecology in the US. Pre-1960 grassroots activism against [[DDT]] in [[Nassau County, New York]], had inspired [[Rachel Carson]] to write her bestseller, ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962). ===Significance of April 22=== Nelson chose the date in order to maximize participation on college campuses for what he conceived as an "environmental teach-in". He determined the week of April 19–25 was the best bet as it did not fall during exams or spring breaks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nelsonearthday.net/earth-day/proposal.htm |title=A proposal reprinted across the country |date=April 18, 2010 |publisher=Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies |deadurl=no |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref> Moreover, it did not conflict with religious holidays such as Easter or Passover, and was late enough in spring to have decent weather. More students were likely to be in class, and there would be less competition with other mid-week events—so he chose Wednesday, April 22. The day also fell after the anniversary of the birth of noted conservationist [[John Muir]].
